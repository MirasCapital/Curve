# .github/workflows/deploy.yml

name: Build and Deploy Frontend

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main # Runs on pushes to the 'main' branch
      # - develop # Uncomment if you also want to run on a 'develop' branch

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # A Linux virtual machine provided by GitHub

    # --- Crucial: Grant permissions for deployment ---
    permissions:
      contents: write # Required to push code (e.g., to gh-pages branch)
      pages: write    # Required for GitHub Pages deployment
      id-token: write # Required for OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication
                      # Best practice for modern GitHub Pages deployments
    # -------------------------------------------------

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18' # Or your specific Node.js version, e.g., '20'

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run the build command
      - name: Build project
        run: npm run build

      # Step 5: Upload build artifacts (Optional but Recommended for debugging/downloading build)
      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: dist-build # Name of the artifact
          path: dist/        # Path to the build output directory (adjust if different)

      # Step 6: Deploy to GitHub Pages
      # This step takes the 'dist' folder and pushes it to the GitHub Pages branch.
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        if: success() # Only deploy if the build was successful
        uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Built-in token, now with write permissions
          publish_dir: ./dist # Path to the directory containing your static files for deployment
          # Optional: Uncomment and specify if your GitHub Pages is configured
          # to publish from a specific branch (e.g., 'gh-pages').
          # If left commented, it often defaults to the 'main' branch if configured
          # to deploy from 'main' or 'docs' folder on 'main'.
          # publish_branch: gh-pages
